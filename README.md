This project is a Job Portal Card User Interface built using React.js and CSS, designed to display job listings in a clean, modern, and responsive card-based layout. The UI showcases essential job-related information such as company name, job title, experience level, job type, location, salary, and an Apply Now action.
The main goal of this project is to practice React component-based architecture and CSS styling, while creating a visually appealing and scalable UI that can be easily extended into a fully functional job portal application.
